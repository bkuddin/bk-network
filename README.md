## BK Network

I'm attempting to create a Network, Called BK Network (BKN) is a international organization consisting of 8 members educators, scientists, extension specialists, industry researchers, administrators, producers, and college students who are committed to advancing the BK Network.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project notes

1. Must generate data, and each data must have five properties, including a numeric.

2. Data cannot be linked to film, sports, or eCommerce. You must loop through using the key.

3. Must have pictures.

4. Three or more columns.

5. There will be a head part; it must include the projects' name inside the head. Incorporating a Total would be noteworthy.

6. The design would be different

7. There will be a Cart; within it will be a number that will display the sum of something and the associated name.

#For Bonus Marks

1. There must be a process of Destructuring.
2. Must be an icon, even if it is one.
3. It is necessary to modify the ReadMe file with three blutes points.
